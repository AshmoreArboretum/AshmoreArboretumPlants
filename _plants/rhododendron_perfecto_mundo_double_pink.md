## Perfecto Mundo Double Pink Reblooming Azalea
*Rhododendron x 'NCRX3' USPP 32*

- **Preferred Light Exposure:** Full sun to partial shade (4+ hours of direct sun ideal; afternoon shade in very hot climates to avoid scorch).
- **Water Needs/Environment Needs:** Consistently moist, well-drained, acidic soil (pH 5.0-6.0 preferred); rich in organic matter; mulch to retain moisture and cool roots; avoid soggy conditions to prevent root rot.
- **Zone Range:** 6-9 (hardy to zone 6b with protection in colder microclimates)
- **Size:** 2-3 feet tall × 2-3 feet wide (mature; neat, rounded, compact form)
- **Bloom Color:** Double pink (pure, saturated pale to medium pink)
- **Prominent Features:** Large, fully double flowers in clusters; heavy spring bloom followed by rebloom from midsummer through fall; evergreen with glossy, dark green foliage resistant to lace bugs and other pests; attracts pollinators; dense, mounding habit; excellent for borders, foundations, containers, mass plantings, or mixed shrub beds.
- **Deer Resistance:** Moderate (azaleas can be browsed, but denser foliage and less appealing texture in this series provide some natural deterrence; not fully deer-proof).

**Plant Summary:** This innovative Proven Winners® reblooming azalea delivers exceptional multi-season color with abundant double pink blooms starting in spring (like traditional azaleas), then continuing heavily from midsummer into fall after a short rest period. It forms a tidy, rounded evergreen shrub with handsome, disease-resistant glossy foliage that stays attractive year-round. Bred for extended bloom time, pest resistance, and reliable performance in Southern gardens (including Atlanta-area conditions), it adds vibrant, long-lasting interest to landscapes while supporting pollinators.
