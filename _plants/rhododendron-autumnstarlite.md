- **Preferred Light Exposure:** Partial shade to full sun (at least 3-4 hours of direct sun; afternoon shade in hotter climates to prevent leaf scorch).
- **Water Needs/Environment Needs:** Consistently moist but well-drained, acidic soil (pH 5.0-6.0 preferred); organic-rich; mulch to retain moisture and cool roots; avoid wet feet to prevent root rot.
- **Zone Range:** 7-10
- **Size:** 3-4 feet tall × 3-4 feet wide (mature; compact rounded form)
- **Bloom Color:** White with pink flecks and stripes
- **Prominent Features:** Large 3-inch single flowers with unique speckled/striped pattern; reblooms in spring, summer, and fall; evergreen with light green foliage; attracts butterflies; dense, globose growth habit; suitable for foundations, hedges, containers, or mass plantings.
- **Deer Resistance:** Moderate (azaleas are often browsed, but fragrance and texture provide some deterrence; not fully deer-proof).

**Plant Summary:** This standout Encore® Azalea cultivar is celebrated for its extended multi-season blooming, producing large, eye-catching white flowers boldly flecked and striped with pink from spring through fall (with heavy flushes in spring and summer, continuing until frost). It forms a compact, densely branched evergreen shrub with attractive light green foliage that provides year-round structure. Bred for reblooming performance and adaptability, it's an excellent choice for Atlanta-area gardens, adding color and pollinator interest to borders, foundations, or woodland edges.
