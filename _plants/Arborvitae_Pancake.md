## Pancake Arborvitae
*Thuja occidentalis 'Pancake'*
*Thuja occidentalis 'Concesarini' PP24013*

- **Preferred Light Exposure:** Full sun (tolerates partial shade but best color and density in full sun).
- **Water Needs/Environment Needs:** Average to moist, well-drained soil; adaptable to sandy or average conditions; mulch to retain moisture; drought-tolerant once established; avoid constantly wet soils.
- **Zone Range:** 3-7 (hardy to -40°F; excellent cold tolerance)
- **Size:** 1 foot tall × 2 feet wide (mature; very dwarf, low-mounding form)
- **Bloom Color:** N/A (non-flowering conifer; valued for foliage)
- **Prominent Features:** Finely textured, sage-green to blue-green scale-like foliage; low, dense, pancake-like rounded habit with no pruning needed; foliage tints slightly blue in fall/winter with bronze hues in extreme cold; evergreen year-round interest; deer resistant; disease/pest tolerant; ideal for rock gardens, borders, containers, edging, foundations, or mass plantings.
- **Deer Resistance:** High (arborvitae can vary, but this cultivar's dense, aromatic foliage and compact form make it less appealing to deer; often listed as deer resistant).

**Plant Summary:** This ultra-dwarf arborvitae cultivar forms a charming, low-profile mound of soft, finely textured evergreen foliage in sage-green to bluish tones, providing year-round structure without any maintenance pruning. It thrives in full sun and adapts to various soils, including sandy ones, while offering excellent cold hardiness, drought tolerance once established, and natural deer deterrence. Perfect for Atlanta-area gardens in rockeries, front borders, containers, or as a low accent—adding subtle texture and evergreen appeal with minimal space requirements.
