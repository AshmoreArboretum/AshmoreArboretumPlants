## Autumn Lilac Encore Azalea
*Rhododendron 'Robles' PP22762*

- **Preferred Light Exposure:** Partial shade to full sun (at least 3-4 hours of direct sun; afternoon shade in hotter climates to prevent leaf scorch).
- **Water Needs/Environment Needs:** Consistently moist but well-drained, acidic soil (pH 5.0-5.5 preferred); organic-rich; mulch to retain moisture and cool roots; avoid wet feet to prevent root rot.
- **Zone Range:** 6-10
- **Size:** 3 feet tall × 3.5 feet wide (mature; compact rounded form)
- **Bloom Color:** Lavender with dark purple freckles
- **Prominent Features:** 2-3 inch single funnel-shaped flowers; reblooms in spring, summer, and fall; evergreen with glossy dark green foliage; attracts butterflies and pollinators; dense, upright growth habit; suitable for borders, foundations, hedges, containers, or mass plantings.
- **Deer Resistance:** Moderate (azaleas are often browsed, but fragrance and texture provide some deterrence; not fully deer-proof).

**Plant Summary:** This vibrant Encore® Azalea cultivar stands out for its multi-season reblooming, featuring bright lavender flowers accented with dark purple freckles that appear in heavy spring flushes and continue sporadically through summer and fall until frost. It develops into a compact, densely branched evergreen shrub with shiny dark green leaves that offer year-round appeal and structure. Bred for reliable performance and pollinator attraction, it's well-suited to Southern gardens like those in Atlanta, enhancing borders, entryways, or small spaces with color and wildlife interest.
