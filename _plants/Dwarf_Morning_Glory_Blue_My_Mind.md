## Blue My Mind Dwarf Morning Glory
*Evolvulus hybrid 'Blue My Mind'*

- **Preferred Light Exposure:** Full sun (best blooming and heat tolerance in full sun; tolerates partial sun but with fewer flowers).
- **Water Needs/Environment Needs:** Well-drained soil; average to low water once established (drought-tolerant in heat); mulch lightly; avoid overwatering to prevent rot; thrives in hot, humid conditions.
- **Zone Range:** 9-11 (grown as annual in cooler zones like Atlanta; tender perennial in frost-free areas)
- **Size:** 6-12 inches tall × 12-24 inches wide (mounding to trailing/spreading habit; trails up to 16-24 inches in containers)
- **Bloom Color:** True deep blue (with small white eye)
- **Prominent Features:** Abundant small funnel-shaped true blue flowers all season (from planting to frost); fuzzy silvery-green foliage; extremely heat and drought tolerant once established; no deadheading needed; attracts pollinators; excellent for containers, hanging baskets, window boxes, groundcover, edging, or rock gardens.
- **Deer Resistance:** Moderate to high (fuzzy foliage and texture deter most deer; not fully proof but low appeal in many reports).

**Plant Summary:** This Proven Winners® standout annual (or tender perennial in warm zones) delivers nonstop vibrant true blue flowers against fuzzy, silvery-green foliage, excelling in the hottest, most humid conditions where many plants falter. It forms a compact, mounding-to-trailing habit that spills beautifully over edges, providing long-lasting color without maintenance. Ideal for Atlanta summers in containers, baskets, borders, or as a tough groundcover—adding bold blue pops and heat-proof performance to landscapes and patios.
