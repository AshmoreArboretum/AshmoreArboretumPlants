## Magnolia 'Ann'
*Magnolia × 'Ann'*

**Preferred Light Exposure:** Full sun to part shade

**Water Needs:** Regular watering — weekly, or more often in extreme heat. Once established, water deeply when the top few inches are dry. Prefers moist, well-drained, loamy soil.

**Hardiness Zones:** 4–9

**Mature Size:** 10–12 ft tall × 10–12 ft wide

**Bloom Color:** Rich purple-red (outside) with lighter pink interior

**Prominent Features:**
- Compact, shrubby, multi-stemmed deciduous small tree/shrub
- Slightly fragrant, tulip-shaped flowers
- Late-blooming (mid to late spring) — helps avoid late frost damage
- Occasional light repeat bloom in summer
- Smooth, attractive gray bark visible in winter
- Ovate medium-green leaves turn yellow in fall

**Deer Resistance:** Moderately resistant (deer usually avoid due to leathery leaves and fragrance, but may browse young plants if hungry)

### Plant Summary
'Ann' is one of the famous "Little Girl" hybrid magnolias, bred by the U.S. National Arboretum from a cross between *Magnolia liliiflora* 'Nigra' and *Magnolia stellata* 'Rosea'. It grows slowly into a dense, rounded, multi-stemmed form that's perfect for smaller gardens, foundations, patios, or as a specimen in mixed borders. The large, chalice-shaped flowers appear reliably in mid-April to early May (depending on your climate), offering a spectacular spring display while mostly escaping damaging late frosts. It performs best in rich, evenly moist but well-drained soil with some afternoon shade in hotter regions.
