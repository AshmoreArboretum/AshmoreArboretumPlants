## Gold Mop False Cypress
*Chamaecyparis pisifera 'Gold Mop'*

- **Preferred Light Exposure:** Full sun to partial shade (best golden color in full sun; tolerates light shade but may green out slightly).
- **Water Needs/Environment Needs:** Average to moist, well-drained soil; adaptable to various types including sandy or clay; mulch to retain moisture; drought-tolerant once established; avoid constantly wet or poorly drained soils to prevent root issues.
- **Zone Range:** 4-8 (hardy to -30°F; good cold tolerance for Atlanta-area winters)
- **Size:** 3-5 feet tall × 3-6 feet wide (mature; slow-growing, mounding to semi-weeping form; may reach 5-7 feet over many years in ideal conditions)
- **Bloom Color:** N/A (non-flowering conifer; valued for foliage color and texture)
- **Prominent Features:** Bright golden-yellow, thread-like, stringy foliage that holds color year-round (intensifies in full sun); soft, pendulous, mop-like habit with semi-weeping branches; evergreen with no pruning needed for shape; deer resistant; disease/pest tolerant; adds bright accent, texture, and winter interest; ideal for rock gardens, borders, foundations, containers, specimen planting, or mixed conifer beds.
- **Deer Resistance:** High (aromatic foliage and texture deter browsing; often listed as deer resistant in nursery guides).

**Plant Summary:** This popular dwarf false cypress cultivar forms a cheerful, low-mounding evergreen shrub with cascading, thread-like foliage in vivid golden-yellow tones that brighten gardens year-round. It grows slowly with minimal care, thriving in full sun for the best color while adapting to average soils and providing natural resistance to deer and pests. Excellent for Atlanta landscapes in rockeries, front borders, containers, or as a colorful accent—offering soft texture, bright evergreen appeal, and a whimsical "mop" shape without any maintenance.
