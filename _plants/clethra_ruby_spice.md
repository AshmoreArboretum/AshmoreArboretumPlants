## Ruby Spice Summersweet
*Clethra alnifolia 'Ruby Spice'*

- **Preferred Light Exposure:** Full sun to part shade (blooms best in full sun; tolerates shade but with fewer flowers).
- **Water Needs/Environment Needs:** Consistently moist to wet, acidic soil (pH 5.0-6.5 preferred); rich in organic matter; mulch to retain moisture; highly tolerant of wet sites, standing water, and salt; drought-tolerant once established but prefers reliable moisture; avoid dry conditions for best performance.
- **Zone Range:** 4-9 (excellent cold hardiness; native to eastern US including Georgia)
- **Size:** 4-6 feet tall × 3-5 feet wide (mature; upright, rounded, densely branched form; spreads slowly by suckers)
- **Bloom Color:** Deep rose-pink to ruby-pink (fragrant spikes)
- **Prominent Features:** Intensely fragrant, bottlebrush-like spikes of deep rose-pink flowers in mid to late summer (July-August); blooms hold color well without fading; glossy dark green foliage turns attractive yellow to golden-brown in fall; attracts butterflies, bees, and pollinators; seed capsules provide winter interest and bird food; deer resistant; pest/disease tolerant; ideal for moist borders, rain gardens, woodland edges, naturalized areas, or near water features.
- **Deer Resistance:** High (aromatic foliage and texture deter deer; often listed as deer resistant in nursery guides).

**Plant Summary:** This standout cultivar of the native summersweet shrub offers exceptional late-summer fragrance and color with rich, non-fading rose-pink flower spikes that bloom when many gardens fade. It forms a dense, upright deciduous shrub with glossy foliage that provides fall interest and supports pollinators. Thriving in moist, acidic soils (perfect for Atlanta's humid conditions and wet spots), it's low-maintenance, salt-tolerant, and deer-resistant—excellent for rain gardens, shrub borders, or naturalistic plantings with year-round appeal.
