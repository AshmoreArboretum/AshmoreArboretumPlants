### Hosta 'Shadowland Wheee!'

**Wheee! Hosta**  
*Hosta hybrid 'Wheee!'*

- **Preferred Light Exposure:** Part shade to full shade  
- **Water Needs/Environment Needs:** Evenly moist, well-drained, organically enriched soil; keep consistently moist but not soggy (do not allow to dry out completely); mulch to retain moisture  
- **Zone Range:** 3-9  
- **Size:** 11-18 inches tall × 24-30 inches wide  
- **Bloom Color:** Light lavender  
- **Prominent Features:** Deciduous perennial, extremely ruffled leaves, thick substance for slug resistance, mounded habit  
- **Deer Resistance:** Low (hostas are highly attractive to deer; thicker leaves help somewhat against slugs but not deer—use repellents or fencing if deer are present)

**Plant Summary:** This distinctive hosta features medium-sized, ruffled green leaves with cream edges, creating a fun, textured appearance in shade gardens or containers. It's a mutation discovered in 2004, with good substance that enhances durability. In midsummer, light lavender flowers emerge on purple scapes, adding vertical interest. It prefers evenly moist soil and performs best with dappled light, making it a low-maintenance filler plant.
